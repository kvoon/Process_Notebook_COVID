# Process_Notebook_COVID
Individual component of a larger group assignment, where each member had to perform individual analysis on COVID data on a specific country. All the process notebooks were then compiled into a single Product Notebook.  

Notebook contains EDA process, and a simple function I coded to create and fill dataframe with random variables for testing purposes.
