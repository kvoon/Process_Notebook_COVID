# Process_Notebook_COVID
This project represented an individual component within a larger group assignment. In this assignment, each team member was responsible for conducting an independent analysis of COVID data for a specific country. The country I decided to analyse was Malaysia. Subsequently, all the individual process notebooks were consolidated into a single Product Notebook for the final submission.

The Product Notebook encompasses an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process and incorporates a simple function that I authored. This function's purpose is to generate and populate a Pandas dataframe with random values for all the values, which is crucial for testing and evaluation. This step ensures the reliability of re-used functions within the broader Product Notebook and serves the important role of confirming that no hardcoding was employed, thereby promoting modularity in the functions.
