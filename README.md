# Process_Notebook_COVID
This project represented an individual component within a larger group assignment. In this assignment, each team member was responsible for conducting an independent analysis of COVID data for a specific country. The country I decided to analyse was Malaysia. Subsequently, all the individual process notebooks were consolidated into a single Product Notebook for the final submission.

The Product Notebook encompasses an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process and incorporates a simple function that I authored. This function's purpose is to generate and populate a Pandas dataframe with random values for all the values, which is crucial for testing and evaluation. This step ensures the reliability of re-used functions within the broader Product Notebook and serves the important role of confirming that no hardcoding was employed, thereby promoting modularity in the functions.

Please note that the values presented in the written analysis might exhibit disparities when compared to the generated graphs and tables. This variation arises from the fact that, at the time this Jupyter Notebook was created, the dataset being used underwent daily updates. Consequently, the values provided in the written analysis accurately represent the data as it existed during the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2020.
